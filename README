From [HTML5Doctor's article about Outlines](http://html5doctor.com/outlines/) :

> The document outline is the structure of a document, generated by the document’s headings, form titles, table titles, and any other appropriate landmarks to [map out the document](http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-UAAG10-20021217/guidelines#tech-provide-outline-view). [...] The outlining algorithm has been clearly defined in the [HTML5 spec](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#outlines).

Unfortunately, although it allows web developers to use only `<h1>`s in their content — useful with Content Management Systems that may generate the same HTML source for several usages — thanks to a hierarchy of sectioning element containing them, most browsers still don't have default CSS rendering for such multi level `<h1>`s.

This is where [HTML5 Titles Inception](https://github.com/nhoizey/HTML5-Titles-Inception) tries to help, with a (not so) little CSS that you can extend.

Fortunately, tools such as [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) exist, so that you don't have to put the whole CSS mess into your files.

Be careful about performance through when using such complex selectors in your CSS.
